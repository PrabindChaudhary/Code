                <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction to Computers</h2>
                <p>This chapter introduces the basic concepts of computers. It covers the definition of a computer, its components, and the types of computers available. You will learn about the various hardware components, such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, and input/output devices. Additionally, the chapter explains the role of software in a computer system, including system software and application software.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is a Computer?</li>
                    <li>Computer Hardware and Software</li>
                    <li>Types of Computers</li>
                    <li>Input and Output Devices</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Details</h3>
                <p>A computer is an electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data. It has a central processing unit (CPU) that performs calculations and manages data. The software instructs the hardware how to perform specific tasks. Computers can be categorized as desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Each of these has distinct characteristics that define their usage.</p>
                <p>Input devices like the keyboard and mouse allow users to communicate with the computer, while output devices like the monitor and printer display the results. The role of software is critical in guiding hardware to perform tasks such as calculations, word processing, and even playing media files.</p>

            <!-- Chapter 2 -->
            <div class="chapter" id="chapter2">
                <h2>Chapter 2: Basics of Programming</h2>
                <p>This chapter introduces programming concepts and tools. It focuses on understanding programming logic, algorithms, and flowcharts. You will learn how to write simple programs in a high-level programming language like Python or C++. The chapter also covers data types, variables, and basic operations such as input, output, and control structures like loops and conditionals.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduction to Programming</li>
                    <li>Algorithms and Flowcharts</li>
                    <li>Data Types and Variables</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Details</h3>
                <p>Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem. Flowcharts are diagrams that represent the logic of the algorithm in a graphical form.</p>
                <p>Variables are used to store data, and each variable has a specific data type (such as integer, float, string). Control structures such as if-else and loops allow programs to make decisions or repeat actions based on conditions.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Chapter 3 -->
            <div class="chapter" id="chapter3">
                <h2>Chapter 3: Operating Systems</h2>
                <p>This chapter explains the concept of operating systems, including their functions and types. You will learn about the kernel, user interface, and the role of an operating system in managing hardware and software resources. The chapter also covers different types of operating systems such as batch, multi-tasking, and real-time operating systems.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is an Operating System?</li>
                    <li>Types of Operating Systems</li>
                    <li>Functions of Operating Systems</li>
                    <li>System Software vs. Application Software</li>
                    <li>Process Management</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Details</h3>
                <p>An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and software resources. It provides a user interface and controls the execution of programs. The OS manages memory, processes, input/output devices, and files. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware.</p>
                <p>Types of operating systems include single-tasking, multitasking, and real-time OS. Multi-tasking allows multiple processes to run simultaneously, while real-time systems handle tasks that require immediate processing, such as controlling industrial machines or medical equipment.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Chapter 4 -->
            <div class="chapter" id="chapter4">
                <h2>Chapter 4: Data Representation</h2>
                <p>This chapter covers how data is represented in computers. It includes topics such as binary and hexadecimal systems, character encoding (ASCII), and how data is stored in memory. You will also learn about image, audio, and video file formats.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Binary System</li>
                    <li>Hexadecimal System</li>
                    <li>Character Encoding (ASCII)</li>
                    <li>Data Storage in Memory</li>
                    <li>Data Compression</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Details</h3>
                <p>In computers, data is represented in binary format, using the digits 0 and 1. The binary system is used because it is easy for computers to process. The hexadecimal system is often used as a more human-readable representation of binary data.</p>
                <p>Character encoding systems like ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) assign a numeric value to each character, making it possible to represent text in a machine-readable form. Data compression techniques are used to reduce the size of files without losing important information, allowing for more efficient storage and transmission.</p>
            </div>
